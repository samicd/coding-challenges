This repo contians some of my solutions to short coding challenges/questions I have completed for fun!

[duplicate_encode.py](https://github.com/samicd/coding-challenges/blob/master/duplicate_encode.py) contains the solution to:

The goal of this exercise is to convert a string to a new string 
where each character in the new string is "(" if that character appears only once in the original string,

Examples
"din"      =>  "((("
"recede"   =>  "()()()"
"Success"  =>  ")())())"
"(( @"     =>  "))(("
